    <h2 class="title">About me</h2>
    <p>
        Alice is a sensible prepubescent girl from a wealthy English family who
        finds herself in a strange world ruled by
        imagination and fantasy. Alice feels
        comfortable with her identity and has a strong sense that her
        environment is comprised of clear,
        logical, and consistent rules and features. Alice's
        familiarity with the world has led one critic to describe
        her as a "disembodied intellect". Alice displays great
        curiosity and attempts to fir her diverse experiences into a
        clear understanding of the world.

                Walt Disney brings Lewis Carroll's fantasy story to life
                in this well done animated classic. Even though many elements from the book were
                dropped, such as the duchess with the baby pig and mock turtle, this
                version is without a doubt the most fomous Alice adaption made.

    <h4>Review</h4>

    <p>Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a
        strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social
        position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of
        entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares
        has s "poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited
        information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed
        with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland.
        Alice maintains a superior attitude and behoves with solicitous indulgence toward
        those she believes are less privileged.
